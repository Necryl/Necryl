- 👋 Hi, I’m @Necryl
- 👀 I love 3d animation and games. And I'm also interested in creating music, though I have yet to start my music journey. My goal is to be a movie director one day, I know, I'm kinda all over the place right now.
- I just hit what other people call, the quarter-life crisis lol. So suddenly I feel pressure to make my own living, and I'm hoping coding can help me achieve this. But to be clear, I love coding for its own sake, and actually I started coding when I was 14.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning python and also git (yep, very much a noob)
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on simple projects where I can use my python skills and grow even more. I have some ideas for a few of my own projects which I will start working on, once I get a handle on using git.
- 📫 How to reach me: just email me at 'necrylthewayfarer@gmail.com'. I check my email frequently, but there are some days when I forget to check my email, so give me two or three days to respond, just in case.
