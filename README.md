- 👋 Hi, I’m @Necryl
- 👀 Things I love: Philosophy, Psychology, Neuroscience, Social Science, computers, programming, blockchains and web 3.0, machine learning, and most of all The Truth (whatever that is)
- 🌱 I know HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python and the Kivy framework (Python). I plan to learn all the web dev stuff (SQL, React, TypeScript, etc) plus Rust, C, C++, Dart and Flutter. Also machine learning frameworks like TensorFlow. Eventually, I might dive into Java, C# and many of the other zillion interesting languages.
- 💞️ I’m open to collaborating with other devs.
- 📫 How to reach me: just email me at 'necrylthewayfarer@gmail.com'. I check my email frequently, but there are some days when I forget to check my email, so give me two or three days to respond, just in case.
