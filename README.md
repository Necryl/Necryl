- 👋 Hi, I’m @Necryl
- 👀 I’m interested in 3d animation and games, and also programming in general. I am also interested in projects related to music (but I little to no experience with music)
- 🌱 I’m currently learning python and actually, using git
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on simple projects where I can use my python skills and grow even more.
- 📫 How to reach me: just email me at 'necrylthewayfarer@gmail.com'. I check my email frequently, but there are some days when I forget to check my email, so give two or three days to respond, just in case.
